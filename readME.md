## MVP

As a player, I want the initial page to load seamlessly.
As a player, I want all buttons necessary to play the game, to be easily visible and clickable.
As a player, I want to be informed if I answered correctly or incorrectly right after submitting my response with a basic x or checkmark.
As a player, I want to be able to restart the game at any point I choose

---------------------

## Playing the Game

The user will want to select their choice based on the question presented. At the time of selection, the user can choose to view the result of their selection or coick on to the next question.
After the final question submission, the user will be shown their percentage. At that time, they can choose to view the answers or replay the game for a higher score.

## Major Hurdles

- Rendering the question to be associated with the appropriate answer

- Re-writing code multiple times to make it as dry as I am able to 

- Having immediate results to an answer be shown only when called and for the particular question the user is on.
